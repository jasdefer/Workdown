//! HTTP mutation contracts — the request and response wire types for
//! the server's write endpoints, plus the mapping to the `operations`
//! layer.
//!
//! Like [`crate::view_data`] and [`crate::schema_data`], these carry a
//! `ts_rs` derive so `cargo xtask gen-types` emits matching TypeScript.
//! The op→[`SetOperation`] mapping lives here (next to the wire shape it
//! decodes) so the server handler stays a thin deserialize-and-dispatch
//! wrapper and the contract is unit-testable in core.
//!
//! Values cross the wire as opaque JSON (`unknown` in TS): the UI knows
//! each field's type from `GET /api/schema` and sends the right JSON
//! shape, while `core`'s coercion remains the source of truth
//! (save-with-warning per ADR-001). `serde_yaml::Value` deserializes
//! straight from a JSON body — its `Deserialize` impl is deserializer-
//! agnostic — so no JSON→YAML conversion step is needed.
